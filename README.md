# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical work for the subject "CP1404 - Programming II" at "James Cook University".
My name is Edmond Xie, this repository is shows my progress in writing cleaner, more maintainable, and well-structured Python code.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Throughout CP1404, I have learnt several important principles about writing clean code:
- Write clear, meaningful commits. I've learned that frequently creating focused commits with descriptive messages made my code history easier to understand and maintain.
- Consistency matter. Especially in python, when following naming conventions and style guidelines (PEP 8) will make the code easier to follow and maintain.
- Creating meaningful names. When creating descriptive variable and function names, it make a massive difference when understanding the code for others and the future significantly easier to read.
